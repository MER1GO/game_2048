# Game 2048 written in C++ using VS2019 with WinForms 
2048 da Game. Simple 2048 logic with the GUI (C++, WinForms, VS 2019)

The 2048 implementation.

The engine based on fixed 4x4 int matrix.

Engine cannot write&read to/from file. GUI do. 
The highest score is stored in highest.dat
Game can run properly without highest.dat file, then it will be created.

To control use WASD(it does what you expect).

Do not press Alt btn in game. Then, the game will crash. Dunno how it works.
